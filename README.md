# Are-the-salaries-in-the-US-better-
We are Yash and Guillermo and we are foreign students. Since we are close to graduation of our masters we are in the process of getting a job. In the US, we have learned that getting a $100,000/year job is somewhat likely to get with our degree. We also know that we would never get such salary in India and Mexico respectively (our home country). However, the question we are solving today is, given the difference in Cost of Living, what salary would we need to find in our home country that can give us the same life quality than earning $100,000/year in the US.
